## Set up the environment

Once forked and cloned, set-up the solution as follows:

1. Open the solution with your favourite IDE (we have used and tested using VS Code)
2. Run npm install to make sure you have all the dependencies set up
3. Run `ng serve -o` and make sure the app is running.

The Angular application depends on a separate .net Core API, you will need this running on your development environment to complete assesment's tasks. To provision the API, please:

1. Clone (or fork and clone) the repo https://github.com/Synetec/synetec-interview-test-net-core-api locally
2. Build the solution
3. Run the Synetec.CityInfo.Api project to host the API
